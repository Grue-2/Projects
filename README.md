# Projects designating interests of mine

These are projects whose broad themes are 
in sync with what I'd love to learn.

## RNG_Scripts - generate cryptographic keys with a TrueRNGv3

### Preface
Getting access to effectively random numbers is not easy.

Sites like Random.org while effective have caps for free entropy, and also record
and take logs of the entropy they give out.

While I don't know enough currently to verify the efficacy of hardware random number
generators(HRNGs) I figured playing with one would be a good learning experience
regardless.

### Purpose

These scripts are for creating binary files filled with entropy generated from
a "TrueRNG3" HRNG. With the intended goal of producing cryptographically useful
binary keys which can be used for one time padding messages.

Now I don't know enough to validate the output, what few tests I can write can't
distinguish PRNGs from HRNGs. So I would not go about using the keys for cryptography
in an important situation. However for test purposes the keys generated have been
good thus far.


### Method of action

The scripts interface with the HRNG which spits out etnropy bits. While the HRNG claims it
whitens its output, the scripts default setting will von Neumann the output again
just in case.

Those spit out entropy bits are stored in a buffer then written to a keyfile.

### User guide

Plug in your TrueRNG3 USB, check which COM port its connected to. (google how)
Compile TrueRNGKeyGen.cpp together with TrueRNGInterface.h. (the later is not my code)

run code where you want the key files to be generated.


If its working it should look like this :

## tic-tac-toe AI
 - Play tic tac toe with an AI

##### Playing the game itself may require javaFX

### Preface
I don't know anything about AI. Figured I'd write a naive AI for fun.

### Purpose
This is sort of a proof of concept. The AI knows nothing about how tic-tac-toe works
to start with other than it can't make invalid moves. After being trained for a while
it can play a decent game of tic-tac-toe.

### Method of action

The AI stores current game state, compares it against its memory of outcomes in those
game states, then takes its preffered action. Based on the game result it adjusts its preferences.

### User guide

Eclipse project, import into eclipse.
The AI has its memory in preferences.ser. You can delete them and retrain executing
the main method in AI_Trainer.java (is not optimized).
Or just to test the AI you can run the main method in "TicTacToeGame.java" which
gives a nice tic tac toe game.
